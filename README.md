Definition of the Analytics Engineer: [The Analytics Engineer](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/). 

### [[Video with In-depth Explanation]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s-KYV9zsWM&t=483s) (for the non-readers ;) )

#####
# Start with the business question. Analytics Engineers supply the data in order to answer business questions as well as responsible for dashboarding as well. Looker is part of the modern data stack.
Looker Community is where busines intelligence folks post/comment, etc. If this is where they hang, then this is where they will talk about their standard [metrics of interest](https://community.looker.com/lookml-5/analytics-block-customer-retention-and-lifetime-value-survival-style-5780) and what they report.

### SQL
SQL has a lot of tips and tricks that take time to know.

It's a gem. Didn't find this kind of insights elsewhere.
  * [Introduction to Algorithmic Marketing](https://algorithmic-marketing.online/). :book: I found good ideas to make more data driven initiatives for marketing. Very dense though, you can pass the equations.

### Thinking with data
These books/articles helped me to think better when analysing data. 

  * [Common Data Mistakes to Avoid](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/data-literacy/statistical-fallacies/). Excellent summary of the most common fallacies when analyzing data. Very clear and well-explained. 
  * [Thinking fast and slow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374533555/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_wOryDb6WC3CVE). Learning about bias can be super useful. For instance, I didn't have the reflex to think of a base rate anytime I see a figure. 
  * [Fooled by randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2QEXPWM35W0BR&keywords=fooled+by+randomness&qid=1566644880&s=books&sprefix=foole%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C207&sr=1-1).
:book: Nassim Taleb taught so much both professionally and personnaly. In Fooled By Randomness, you will learn about major pitfalls when dealing with data in **real life**. 
  * [Why you should care about the Nate Silver vs. Nassim Taleb Twitter war](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-care-about-the-nate-silver-vs-nassim-taleb-twitter-war-a581dce1f5fc). Great chess players learn from high elo games. Great data people learn from debate between data experts. 
  * [Five books every data scientist should read that are not about data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/five-books-every-data-scientist-should-read-that-are-not-about-data-science-f7335fb1f84f). I have not read them all yet. But these suggestions seems judicious. 


### Data Visualisation 
   * [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/). Complete guide to visualisation. Free version online.

### Github-Gitlab repo to learn from
I found that reading code helps to know the best practices whether it is Python or SQL.

In Python reading some taps from [Singer](https://github.com/singer-io) can teach you a lot. 

In dbt/SQL I like to browse [a repo open-sourced by Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt)


### Against ELT
The concept of analytics engineering is tightly coupled with the ELT view of data warehousing. It is interesting to learn from the people that would prefer the ETL. 
[Reddit comments on Snowflake super-expensive cost](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/is39id/snowflake_cost_analysis/)


### Other readings lists

   The GitLab data team also made an [excellent list](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#data-learning-and-resources). (close to mine)

[Analytics Dispatch](https://mode.com/analytics-dispatch) by Mode Analytics. Very comprehensive.

I really love [Reading in Applied Data Science](https://github.com/hadley/stats337#readings) for a more data science focused view.  

Knowing more about programming is an huge asset. For instance [Professional Programming list](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) is quite complete.
